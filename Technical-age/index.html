            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
            <br/>
            <code>print('Hello world')
               <br> >>> Hello World!
            </code>
        </p>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of

            This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
            Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
            Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            <br><br>
            <code>print ("Hello World")
                <br>
                >>> Hello World
            </code>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
        </p>

    <section id= "if_else" class="main-section">
        <header >
            if...else statement

        <p>
            Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
            <br><br>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements.

            Global Variables
        </header>
        <p>
            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
           <br><br>
            <code>
                #To declear a global variable you say Global then the variable
                <br>
                global
                <br><br>
                tune= #this is the global variable created
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

                    It can not be reassigned only logic can be used with it
