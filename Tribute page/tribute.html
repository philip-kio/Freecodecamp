      <p id= "take"> <bold>"Ab-Soul is an increadible human who inspires me and  it is more amzing for me because i was born during his lifetime. With a gap of ten years between us i can  imagine what it will be like for me in the next few years. Why do I say so ? One of my favourite lines of Ab-Soul is <em>"I am not talented I am skilled..." </em>and another which says<em> "I chose rap, rap did not choose me..."</em>
These lines make it immpossible for me to fail, because Ab-SOul is extra-ordinarily talented and he felt not so a few years bak and developed his skill and now he is really a Rapper's Rapper, I beleive and I know that my metamorphosis will be seen as I grow as a Developer, a Geologist and  a Rapper".<br><br>---Philip Ireoluwa Okiokio</bold></p>
